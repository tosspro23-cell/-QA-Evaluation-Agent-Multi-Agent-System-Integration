# QA Evaluation Agent ‚Äî Autonomous Quality Supervisor for Multi-Agent Systems

**QA Evaluation Agent** is an intelligent, autonomous quality supervisor designed to **evaluate, benchmark, and continuously optimize** the performance of multi-agent systems in enterprise environments.  
It operates as a *meta-agent* that monitors and refines how other agents perform ‚Äî ensuring reliability, consistency, and operational excellence at scale.

Embedded within the **CritSit Multi-Agent Framework**, it analyzes each agent‚Äôs input‚Äìoutput cycle, measures factual accuracy, relevance, and completeness against domain-specific standards, and generates actionable feedback loops for continuous fine-tuning.

By automating the quality assurance process across multiple agents, the QA Agent **reduces manual QA workload, improves trust in AI-driven workflows, and establishes transparent governance** ‚Äî a key requirement for enterprise-grade AI orchestration.

## Mission & Purpose

> ‚ÄúTo ensure every agent is intelligently evaluated, intelligently improved, and continuously optimized.‚Äù

The QA Evaluation Agent acts as the *Quality & Performance Meta-Supervisor* in the system.  
It intelligently reviews agent outputs, detects deviations from standards, and recommends corrective actions ‚Äî at both the **prompt** and **system** level.

---

## System Architecture Overview

- **Functional Agents** ‚Äì Specialized in execution (e.g., Context Refreshing, CritSit Advisor, Executive Communication).  
- **QA Evaluation Agent** ‚Äì Oversees and evaluates all functional agents, providing diagnostic metrics and optimization recommendations.  
- **Feedback Loop** ‚Äì Integrates QA results into retraining and prompt refinement cycles for self-improving multi-agent coordination.

## Why It Matters

This QA Agent transforms traditional manual QA into **intelligent, data-driven supervision**,  
enabling organizations to scale AI solutions with **confidence, accountability, and continuous improvement** ‚Äî essential pillars of responsible AI deployment.


### üîπ Functional Agents
| Agent Name | Primary Function | Input | Output |
|-------------|------------------|--------|---------|
| **CritSit Advisor** | Provides crisis analysis and response strategy | Incident data, Wiki, SOP | Actionable strategy report |
| **Exec Comm Agent** | Creates executive communication updates | Case summary, impact notes | Executive-style email or report |
| **Wiki Agent** | Retrieves or updates internal knowledge base | Query / SOP reference | Structured knowledge snippet |
| **KYC Agent** | Handles customer profile and identity verification | Customer data | Verification summary |
| **Resourcing Agent** | Suggests staffing and scheduling solutions | Availability data, workload | Staffing recommendation |
| **Handover Agent** | Prepares case transition documentation | Case log, summary | Transfer-ready handover document |

All of these agents log their **input, output, timestamp, and context snapshot** into a shared datastore accessible by the QA Evaluation Agent.

##  QA Evaluation Agent ‚Äî Workflow Logic

### **1. Data Collection**
- Collects logs from all agents (input/output/context)
- Pulls corresponding Wiki, SOP, or DFM as **Ground Truth**
- Includes human feedback or manual annotations

### **2. Preprocessing**
- Performs anonymization and text normalization  
- Segments data into:
  - **Facts**
  - **Recommendations / Actions**
  - **Communication / Tone**

### **3. Rule-based Validation**
- Checks if outputs comply with templates and structural rules  
  e.g. Executive Updates must include: *Issue / Impact / Status / Action Plan*  
- Verifies all mandatory fields are present  
- Confirms outputs align with internal SOP

### **4. Semantic Evaluation**
- Uses **RAG + LLM hybrid analysis**:
  - **RAG** retrieves relevant knowledge from Wiki/DFM  
  - **LLM** validates factual accuracy, reasoning consistency, and tone alignment  
- Outputs multidimensional quality scores:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Consistency**
  - **Completeness**
  - **Tone / Format**
  - **Latency**

### **5. Scoring & Classification**
- Aggregates all sub-scores into a **Confidence Index** (0‚Äì100)
- Classifies results:
  - üü• *Critical* (<50)
  - üüß *Major* (50‚Äì70)
  - üü® *Minor* (70‚Äì85)
  - üü© *Healthy* (>85)

### **6. Diagnostics & Suggestions**
- Generates two types of improvement recommendations:
  - **Prompt-level fixes**: e.g. ‚ÄúAdd missing Action Plan section‚Äù
  - **System-level fixes**: e.g. ‚ÄúExpand retrieval window‚Äù  
- Outputs directly executable **Prompt Patch** or **Config Patch**

### **7. Sandbox A/B Testing**
- Automatically re-runs the task in a sandbox environment using the patch  
- Compares pre/post KPI metrics:
  - Accuracy Œî
  - Completeness Œî
  - Response latency Œî  
- Logs results to the QA dashboard for continuous learning

### **8. Reporting & Visualization**
- Produces two report types:
  - **Case-level QA Report** (per execution)
  - **Agent Performance Trend Report** (periodic summary)
- Metrics are visualized in Streamlit or PowerBI dashboards

### **9. Human-in-the-Loop**
- QA engineers or managers review the report, approve or reject suggestions  
- Accepted improvements feed back into **training and system config updates**

### **10. Scoring Dimensions**

| **Dimension**        | **Description**                        | **Evaluation Method**    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Accuracy             | Alignment with verified knowledge base | RAG + LLM fact-checking  |
| Consistency          | No conflicts across agents‚Äô outputs    | Cross-agent comparison   |
| Completeness         | Structural and field integrity         | Rule-based validation    |
| Tone / Format        | Style compliance with templates        | Regex + LLM tone check   |
| Latency              | Execution efficiency                   | API timing logs          |
| **Confidence Index** | Weighted composite of all above        | Aggregated scoring model |

### **11. Roadmap (4 Weeks)**

| **Week** | **Goal**                                        | **Deliverable**          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1        | Log ingestion & data normalization              | Data Collector module    |
| 2        | Rule-based checks                               | Basic scoring engine     |
| 3        | Semantic evaluation + recommendation generation | Automated QA report      |
| 4        | A/B testing + dashboard visualization           | Full QA Demo & Dashboard |

### **12. Expected Impact**

| **Metric**                  | **Improvement**        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Manual QA time              | ‚Üì 80%                  |
| Output deviation            | ‚Üì 50%                  |
